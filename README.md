## Various pictures for my 3blue1brown internship application 

This is a selection of random graphical elements from my journals in no particular order. They are not meant to show any particularly detailed, skillful, or complete work, but rather only demonstrate that I understand the basic elements and reasoning of illustrative representation. Some of them also demonstrate that I know how to incorporate illustrations into a written work.

A diagram of a computer from when I was doing some idiosyncratic theorizing about computer science

![Political Polarization](./IMG_20210409_145639__01.jpg)
A rough illustration of "political polarization" within "policy space"

![Waves](./IMG_20210409_150058__01.jpg)
Just some waves. Particularly, "fractal waves" as inspired by the Weierstrass function.

![Fibonacci](./IMG_20210409_150118__01.jpg)
A neat representation of the fibonacci sequence, also showing its relation to the golden ratio. Similar representation for the tribonacci and tetranacci versions.

Rectangle space

An attempt at formulating a "vowel space"

![On Generation and Corruption](./IMG_20210409_150921__01.jpg)
My version of formulating Aristotle's theory of elements from On Generation and Corruption. Compare [Leibniz's (more ornamental) version](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Fotothek_df_tg_0005486_Mathematik_%5E_Kombinatorik.jpg)...
